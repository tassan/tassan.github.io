I'm Flávio Tassan, a passionate software engineer focused on technology, innovation, and driving real impact in business. With over 9 years of experience in backend, cloud, and systems architecture, I have led and contributed to projects in e-commerce, insurance, and education — taking initiatives from concept to delivery.

My specialty is building robust, scalable, and secure solutions using modern technologies such as .NET, Azure, AWS, Terraform, containers, and Agile methodologies. I enjoy translating complex challenges into practical results, always seeking efficiency, quality, and continuous learning.

Beyond technical work, I have a collaborative mindset, mentoring teams, promoting best practices, and fostering innovation. I am currently expanding my expertise in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, exploring the power of AI for industry and automation.

Outside of coding, I value family, great books, travel, and personal growth. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and businesses, and I am always ready for new challenges — in Brazil and around the world.
